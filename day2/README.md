### Application
The exerices above are only piece of the larger appliation. As we are constrained by time we  have select a subset of the labs to complete. If wish step through the entire lab I recommend navigating to the original source material [training](https://github.com/azuredevcollege/trainingdays/tree/master/day2)


### Result 

At the end of the serverless lab 
 - Create a event drive function which reacts upon file uploads and resized an image 
 - Create a logic app which consumer an Service bus topic and places the content into a storage account
